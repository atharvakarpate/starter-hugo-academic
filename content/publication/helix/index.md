abstract: Addiction is defined as a compulsive need for and use of a habit-forming substance characterized by tolerance and well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal. With the onset of the internet and the subsequent widespread ease of access to it, the average human life has been deeply impacted and affected by it. This is evident and characterized by the gradual but definite inculcation of the internet into the daily lives of human beings, so much so that addiction to the internet is recognized as a legitimate and booming mental disorder by World Health Organization. The present age group of 20-30 years has been raised with the internet as a very integral and substantial informative source in their upbringing. Considering how this age group is of employable age and seeks jobs, it becomes of utmost relevance to study internet addiction disorder and to find out its effects and implications in job productivity, keeping in mind the unquestionable role of internet to carry out daily functions of an average work environment. Thus, the paper aims to find out the effect of internet addiction on workplace productivity in Alacrity (BPO) located in city of Nagpur. Sales reports and performance linked incentive (PLI) reports were collected for 100 employees working in BPO sector, aged between 18-28. The data thus collected was tabulated in the form of daily internet usage and PLI earned, over a period of one year for fiscal year 2017-18. The data was collected through telephonic conversation. After studying the tabulated data of Internet usage and PLI earned, it was concluded that the average PLI earned by the employees decreased with the subsequent substantial increase in the internet usage amongst employees in the fiscal year 2017-18.
