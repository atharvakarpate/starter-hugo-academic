abstract: Every year Industrial fires lead to tremendous economic and human loss. Real-time fire detection and localisation remains a serious challenge, especially for the industrial environment. With the substantial growth of Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) in recent years, one of the most important applications of it has been in the area of fire detection and protection. In this paper, we present a low-cost and scalable wireless sensor network-based system for fire detection and localisation. To analyse the fire source and spread in real-time we also present a fire map generation mechanism in our system. Various sensor configurations are tried to optimize fire detection and localisation coverage.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
