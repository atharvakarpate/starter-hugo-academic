abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized computing with a multitude of applications being built around various types of sensors. That includes an extraordinary number of objects of all shapes and sizes â€“ from smart microwaves, which automatically cook food, to self-driving cars, whose complex sensors detect objects in their path. A vast amount of activity is seen in IoT based product-lines and this activity is expected to grow in the years to come with projections of up to a Trillion connected devices. With this exponential projected growth in the number of IoT devices, security of these resource constrained and often remotely located devices becomes paramount. Most of the IoT devices come with factory installed firmware. The firmware of IoT devices is not generally updated during their lifetime. So, they are more prone to attacks which may lead to severe problems. Providing timely firmware updates can greatly reduce the security risk for IoT devices. The domain name system is one of the foundations of the internet, which is mainly used to store and retrieve IP addresses from domain names. DNS supports various record types such as A, AAAA,etc. which store different kinds of information about the queried domain name. One such newly proposed record type is the OX record type. The project aims to investigate the suitability of the OX record type with its various available fields to securely update the firmware of IoT devices. As the number of devices on the internet increase, the world is slowly moving from the old IPv4 to the new Ipv6 protocol. Hence, this project is mainly being implemented for Ipv6 based IoT devices.
